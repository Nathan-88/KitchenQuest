# KitchenQuest
KitchenQuest aims to solve the challenge of deciding what to cook based on the ingredients available to users. Often, people find themselves with a collection of ingredients but lack the inspiration to create a meal. This application will bridge that gap by suggesting recipes that can be prepared using the ingredients the user already has. 

But we didn't stop there. We also understand the importance of dietary preferences. Whether you're a vegetarian, following a Ketogenic diet, or need gluten-free options, we've got you covered. With KitchenQuest, you can search for recipes based on your preferences, and we'll provide you with a tailored list of delicious options. It's designed to streamline the cooking process, reduce food waste, and offer creative culinary options even when faced with limited ingredients.
